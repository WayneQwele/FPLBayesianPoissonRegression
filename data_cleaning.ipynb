    "\n",
    "The Premier League Fantasy Football, often referred to as FPL [(Fantasy Premier League)](https://fantasy.premierleague.com), is an online fantasy sports game based on the English Premier League (EPL), which is one of the top football leagues in the world. Here's a brief description of the Premier League Fantasy League:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**: FPL is a virtual football management game where participants create their own fantasy football teams by selecting real-life players from the English Premier League. These virtual teams then compete against each other based on the real-life performance of the selected players during Premier League matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team Creation**: Participants start by selecting a squad of 15 players from the Premier League teams while adhering to a predefined budget. The squad typically consists of two goalkeepers, five defenders, five midfielders, and three forwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Player Selection**: Participants can choose from a wide range of Premier League players, each assigned a specific value (price) based on their expected performance. Balancing the budget while selecting top-performing players is a key strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring**: Points are awarded to FPL teams based on the actual performance of their selected players in Premier League matches. Points are earned for actions such as goals, assists, clean sheets, saves (for goalkeepers), and more. Points are deducted for actions like yellow and red cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transfers and Strategy**: Throughout the Premier League season, participants can make a limited number of transfers to improve their squads. Managing injuries, suspensions, and fixtures is crucial for success. Captains and vice-captains can be chosen each gameweek for bonus points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duration**: The game is played for an 9 months of the year, and thousands of enthusiast compete to be the top performing team."
